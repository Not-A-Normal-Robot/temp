## "I'm somehow trapped in this game."
> Intern editor Yuan Weiteng

Flore lost again.

Maybe "lose" isn't the right word. Normally winning and losing comes from competition, you can only lose if someone wins. Flore isn't playing with anyone. No one points a gun at him, no character dies, no warp to home, and no cutscene of the base being destroyed. So maybe this isn't a lose.

But Flore still thinks he lost. What he's playing is Tetris - many versions of them. Blocks stack on top of each other and arrange in lines, players control the falling blocks, clear, and score. In these games, Flore experienced unprecedented sense of failure. The reason of failure is speed. In other words, he's not fast enough.

For a regular person, Tetris can't be simpler. Stack, clear, keep the blocks away from the ceiling. But to Flore, Tetris is a race, and it needs speed, concentration, power, and precision. The rules are simple: clear 40 lines as fast as possible. Flore's personal record is 27.432 seconds, which means he drops 3.5 pieces each second, and clear 1.5 lines.

In China Mainland, there are 22 people ahead of him.

Flore's "lose" is relative.

There are footage of his Sprint games. To a regular player, the pieces in the videos fall at blazing speed, like raindrop, and turn into two delicate and dense peaks, with a valley in the middle - Sprint runners like to split the stack in two, build on the sides, leave a one-wide gap in the middle, and fill the gap in after accumulating some blocks and make a swift clear. The visuals of the line clear reach the brain faster than the sound effect, and the effect is immediately followed by another visual. It goes on and on, like the lightning in a thunderstorm.

When a normal person sees his gameplay, the first reaction is usually "You can play Tetris like that?" To most people, Tetris is but a "puzzle game" on those old TV sets. This kind of idea is sometimes full of bias, and see its side that is casual and not hardcore. To put it harshly, to many people, Tetris is a game for kids.

Regardless of what others view it, Flore values the result more than the process. Losing is losing, which is being slower than other people. In a speedy game of Tetris, the game tracks the time of each game in seconds, and accurate to 3 decimal places. Winning and losing is a simple result, there no room for debate.

Flore often feels anxious. In real life, he is a calm and easy going person, and his "most important value" is to respect other people's feelings. His friends think that he is "nice" and "caring". But when it comes to Tetris, he becomes totally different. He curses when he loses, he curses when he's doing bad. He always has lots of strong language and has to vent them out.

He knows a few foreign languages. If the games are too bad and goes over-the-top angry, he starts to curse in languages that other people don't understand. There is also a difference in what language he uses. He most commonly uses French, which is fluent in, and is easy for him to use. Other languages are less fluent, and the only purpose of them is to swear. I asked him why swear with a foreign language. He answered, "I don't want to ruin other people's mood with my F words".

Actually he doesn't curse other people, he only curses himself. In games he's never angry at other people, but he is strict with himself. His social media bio reads "Why flore so weak" - and it's not quite enough, so he copy pasted this until the character limit - 7 times.

The time when it was worst was the time when it was the closest to success. Two months ago, Flore slumped in a chair and posted in his social media: "I'm not angry. I'm not angry at all. I'm very calm, there isn't a single wave in my heart." He emphasized, he is "really, really, really [not angry]". Below the text is a screenshot, with two stacks of blocks, 4 layers tall, and a vertical long bar nearly managed to clear it. The counter says it's the last 4 lines, with timer at 0:30.683, and should it not have gone wrong, it would have broke his personal record by nearly 1 second.

What does one second mean to him? Flore made a line graph, not only to keep track of his records but also to urge him practice. The y axis is time. Since January 2021, he makes progress about every half a month, sometimes by 0.7 second, sometimes by merely 0.1 second. The process of cutting down the time is like a worm eating tree leaves: the large chunks are gone, leaving the veins to tackle. Only rarely - once in the past year - can he make a progress of over 1 second.

The chance was golden, but he messed up. Murphy's law is real - you always get what you don't want. It's just that one block, but it was nonetheless dropped to the side, stuck there on the top of the foundation, making the already-tall stack taller, like a skinny old man idly staring at the gap below. Flore slams on the pause button, and lost all his strength. He slumped into his chair. His mind was blank.

He's shocked. Like being struck by a lightning. "My head was empty. Somehow I didn't feel that much pity, just lying in my bed, lying for the rest of the day, didn't do anything else." He knows it's just one record, and he would sooner or later get there again. Whether it's the pity of a mistake or the pride of success, it would always be overtaken and be buried in history. He knows all the logic, but still feels bad.

Because no one will know whether your improvement will be the last one. Tetris speed players all know that your score doesn't necessarily improve with your practice. Just like any skill, gaming skills also have a plateau. Many people get better really fast at the beginning, and then some day get stuck at somewhere and unable to surpass the past record. They call it the "ceiling". It's like an invisible wall. They practice, they advance, until one they hit the wall and unable to move further.

Flore knows this. His training is intense. He trains for two whole hours each day, or when he's really into it, he might go on for 7 or 8 hours, until the fingers hurt. Sprint requires you to make no mistake while going at full speed. Clearing 40 lines need at least 100 pieces, and one is bound to make a mistake with such a number. Mistakes, however, are fine, just restart the game, over and over again, until you reach a valid score. Usually one game is just 30 seconds for him, but only a handful of games will reach the end for the whole day worth of practice.
