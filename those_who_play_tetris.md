## "I'm somehow trapped in this game."
> Intern editor Yuan Weiteng

Flore lost again.

Maybe "lose" isn't the right word. Normally winning and losing comes from competition, you can only lose if someone wins. Flore isn't playing with anyone. No one points a gun at him, no character dies, no warp to home, and no cutscene of the base being destroyed. So maybe this isn't a lose.

But Flore still thinks he lost. What he's playing is Tetris - many versions of them. Blocks stack on top of each other and arrange in lines, players control the falling blocks, clear, and score. In these games, Flore experienced unprecedented sense of failure. The reason of failure is speed. In other words, he's not fast enough.

For a regular person, Tetris can't be simpler. Stack, clear, keep the blocks away from the ceiling. But to Flore, Tetris is a race, and it needs speed, concentration, power, and precision. The rules are simple: clear 40 lines as fast as possible. Flore's personal record is 27.432 seconds, which means he drops 3.5 pieces each second, and clear 1.5 lines.

In China Mainland, there are 22 people ahead of him.

Flore's "lose" is relative.

There are footage of his Sprint games. To a regular player, the pieces in the videos fall at blazing speed, like raindrop, and turn into two delicate and dense peaks, with a valley in the middle - Sprint runners like to split the stack in two, build on the sides, leave a one-wide gap in the middle, and fill the gap in after accumulating some blocks and make a swift clear. The visuals of the line clear reach the brain faster than the sound effect, and the effect is immediately followed by another visual. It goes on and on, like the lightning in a thunderstorm.

When a normal person sees his gameplay, the first reaction is usually "You can play Tetris like that?" To most people, Tetris is but a "puzzle game" on those old TV sets. This kind of idea is sometimes full of bias, and see its side that is casual and not hardcore. To put it harshly, to many people, Tetris is a game for kids.

Regardless of what others view it, Flore values the result more than the process. Losing is losing, which is being slower than other people. In a speedy game of Tetris, the game tracks the time of each game in seconds, and accurate to 3 decimal places. Winning and losing is a simple result, there no room for debate.

Flore often feels anxious. In real life, he is a calm and easy going person, and his "most important value" is to respect other people's feelings. His friends think that he is "nice" and "caring". But when it comes to Tetris, he becomes totally different. He curses when he loses, he curses when he's doing bad. He always has lots of strong language and has to vent them out.

He knows a few foreign languages. If the games are too bad and goes over-the-top angry, he starts to curse in languages that other people don't understand. There is also a difference in what language he uses. He most commonly uses French, which is fluent in, and is easy for him to use. Other languages are less fluent, and the only purpose of them is to swear. I asked him why swear with a foreign language. He answered, "I don't want to ruin other people's mood with my F words".

Actually he doesn't curse other people, he only curses himself. In games he's never angry at other people, but he is strict with himself. His social media bio reads "Why flore so weak" - and it's not quite enough, so he copy pasted this until the character limit - 7 times.

The time when it was worst was the time when it was the closest to success. Two months ago, Flore slumped in a chair and posted in his social media: "I'm not angry. I'm not angry at all. I'm very calm, there isn't a single wave in my heart." He emphasized, he is "really, really, really [not angry]". Below the text is a screenshot, with two stacks of blocks, 4 layers tall, and a vertical long bar nearly managed to clear it. The counter says it's the last 4 lines, with timer at 0:30.683, and should it not have gone wrong, it would have broke his personal record by nearly 1 second.

<br />*("ps. my PB is 31.613 seconds")*

What does one second mean to him? Flore made a line graph, not only to keep track of his records but also to urge him practice. The y axis is time. Since January 2021, he makes progress about every half a month, sometimes by 0.7 second, sometimes by merely 0.1 second. The process of cutting down the time is like a worm eating tree leaves: the large chunks are gone, leaving the veins to tackle. Only rarely - once in the past year - can he make a progress of over 1 second.

The chance was golden, but he messed up. Murphy's law is real - you always get what you don't want. It's just that one block, but it was nonetheless dropped to the side, stuck there on the top of the foundation, making the already-tall stack taller, like a skinny old man idly staring at the gap below. Flore slams on the pause button, and lost all his strength. He slumped into his chair. His mind was blank.

He's shocked. Like being struck by a lightning. "My head was empty. Somehow I didn't feel that much pity, just lying in my bed, lying for the rest of the day, didn't do anything else." He knows it's just one record, and he would sooner or later get there again. Whether it's the pity of a mistake or the pride of success, it would always be overtaken and be buried in history. He knows all the logic, but still feels bad.

Because no one will know whether your improvement will be the last one. Tetris speed players all know that your score doesn't necessarily improve with your practice. Just like any skill, gaming skills also have a plateau. Many people get better really fast at the beginning, and then some day get stuck at somewhere and unable to surpass the past record. They call it the "ceiling". It's like an invisible wall. They practice, they advance, until one they hit the wall and unable to move further.

Flore knows this. His training is intense. He trains for two whole hours each day, or when he's really into it, he might go on for 7 or 8 hours, until the fingers hurt. Sprint requires you to make no mistake while going at full speed. Clearing 40 lines need at least 100 pieces, and one is bound to make a mistake with such a number. Mistakes, however, are fine, just restart the game, over and over again, until you reach a valid score. Usually one game is just 30 seconds for him, but only a handful of games will reach the end for the whole day worth of practice.

Repetitive, boring and useless grinding started to slowly grind off the spirits of the players. Flore sometimes cries too. The strongest emotional breakdown was in August this year, when his own time didn't improve for a long time, but two friends who mainly play battle just "casually broke records". At 4 pm, one of them broke his record by one second, and at 6 pm, the other friend got it too, also with admirable improvements.

Battle is another mode of Tetris. You might have heard of *Tetris 99*. Some people call it "Tetris battle royale", but the community often calls it "T99". A common misunderstanding is that Tetris is a single player game, but it couldn't be more wrong. "T99", for instance, is an online battle game. In the game, 99 players play against each other, sending their cleared lines to opponents' fields under certain rules. Faster players clear more and send more attack, while slower players get eliminated one by one; the last surviving player wins. It's also fun to play.

<br />*(A 99-player battle royale.)*

Online battle modes aren't originated from T99. Similar battle modes have always been a main mode of Tetris games. Of course, more players are familiar with 1v1 battle or with a small group of people, instead of a 99-player battle royale, though the rules are largely the same.

Compared to Sprint, the main mode is actually Battle. The PvP combats bring a lot of fun. If we say Sprint is like a boring grind in the gym, then battle is like a friendly game on the field. Even though both modes are Tetris, the two sides are completely different. Sprint only calls for speed, but battle calls for striking the hardest when the opponent is the weakest. Battle's attack system prefers combos, spins and Tetrises, thus have very different strategies from Sprint. When you play different modes, you would also naturally train in different directions.

Thus, Flore cannot accept the records of his friends. Not like he doesn't hope his friends do well, but why, despite all his hard work, can't even compare with the casual lunch break game of someone else? He completely fell into this thought. He saw his own failure from others' achievement - or sometimes not even quite "achievement".

Flore broke down. He cried out loud, in a small groupchat with a handful of players. He sends out the voice messages, with words and cries and sobs blended together, one message after another, without even caring about other people's reactions. This isn't common at all, but his friends don't feel strange. Rather than surprise, they showed their acceptance, responding to an out-of-control emotion with the most appropriate approach. They all understand the situation well. They reply to Flore one by one.

"What did they say back then?" I asked him.

"I'm fine. It's the past, and I don't want to look back for now." His tone lowered.

... ...

"Am I not being polite?" He asked me with a bit hesitation.

"How come?"

"You know, like, ... jealous. Like the seven sins."

The Tetris community in China isn't a big. It's not us being modest about it; the community worldwide isn't big either. In China, almost all active players know almost all other active players - if you mention one to another, they can often tell you a bit about how good and how active they are.

"Community" here practically means specifically QQ group chats. Chinese Tetris players are mostly within a dozen or so groups, with 100 to 3000 members in each one, and around 5000 total if you account for duplicates. To them, Tetris is simply "fun", and because of this, "having fun" is more important than winning.

On May 28th, 2010, an 8th grader created what eventually became the biggest Tetris community in China. The initial goal of the groupchat was simple, or you might even say casual - to make a Tetris game that "has the best handling by my standards". The game was made wih Visual Basic 6, which he learned from a classmate in grade 4. The classmate also played Tetris and learned programming from a book, he then learned from the classmate. He wasn't good at it, but after some fiddling around, he eventually made a working game.

He created the groupchat, simply named "Tetris Research". "After all it's for collecting feedback for the game, so the name is quite programmer-ish." He also came up with a weird nickname: "Farter". His game attracted many Tetris players, and through the word of mouth, all Tetris players in China eventually knew about this weird name. Calling a person "fart" still isn't the most appropriate, so people added a title, and started calling him "Uncle Farter".

"Making a perfect Tetris game" is a goal shared by more than just one person, and many player have plans to make their own Tetris game. Speaking of a fan-made game, many community members might think of another game - *Techmino*, by MrZ, a college junior.

![](https://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/bb73382a8b277ccd0312615a8d339cfc28d9d4ac.jpg@942w_437h_progressive.webp) <br />*(Main menu of Techmino.)*

What is special about this game? MrZ explained that Tetris game are roughly divided into two categiries, "delay Tetris" and "delayless Tetris". The delay doesn't refer to input delay in the usual sense, but the delay between two actions. A way to measure said delay is by Delayed Auto Shift (DAS for short). When you hold a direction key, the block will stop for a while after moving one block, then continue moving at a constant speed.

It sounds like a bit abstract. When explaining this concept, MrZ told me to change my input method to Chinese *([sic]. TL: I think they mean English)*, then hold the "A" key. I followed, and a string of letter "a" appeared in the text box.

"See? There is a pause between the first and second letters appearing. Tetris is the same, and two movements have a pause in between, which we call delay."

"The other type of delay is line delay." He continued. Line delay is the delay after the player clears a line, including the animation for the clearing as well as for the blocks above to fall down. It's a short delay, usually counted in milliseconds, but has a significant impact on how the game feels. Let's just take Sprint: clear 40 lines, and each line clear has 400ms delay, in the most extreme case it can add up to 16 seconds, while the delayless Sprint world record is even less than 15 seconds. There is such a difference so that players always compete within one rule set; you can't compare across rule sets.

If a game has delays, players call it "delay Tetris", otherwise they call it "delayless Tetris". The former is less popular than the latter.

Tetris has mostly set rules, so when one wants to make a better game, what they work on is in the details and fine tuning. Those games that have an official Tetris license almost employed the same set of standards, and the more popular ones mostly have delays, which Chinese players don't like. MrZ wants every player to find it comfortable to play, so he just made most important parameters manually adjustable. To him, softwares are just like hardares, with no hard standards of good or bad; it's good as long as you are comfortable with it.
